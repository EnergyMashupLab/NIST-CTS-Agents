# Background

Transactive Resource Management (TRM) enables Actors representing systems that
use or supply a resource—any commodity whose value is defined by time and
delivery location— to coordinate behaviors without the need for central control.
TRM-based systems engage Actors in markets to manage supply and demand of a
resource over time. Markets enable emergent behavior—new behavior related to
actors and relationships as actors meet their internal needs.

TRM systems are highly resilient, as Actors can join or leave the system without
additional integration. TRM applications include managing power distribution,
smart power grids, smart water, bandwidth sharing, placement of web and social
media ads, and wastewater management.

When the resource is electric power, TRM is called Transactive Energy (TE).
Transactive Energy is already used to manage the bulk power grid. TE is
considered essential to developing new resilient power grids, to transform
legacy power grids, and to build resource-constrained grids.

Actor-based architectures enable hyper-scalable applications that are easy to
design, build, and maintain. Actor Interactions are limited to defined messages,
so they support diversity of participants and technologies. Market transaction
messages create self-optimizing systems of suppliers, consumers, and
distribution.

This project allows Transactive Energy User Agents (TEUA) to interact through
Markets. TEUAs interacts with a Market Agent/Actor (MA) that encapsulates market
behavior. While the project uses a Bilateral Market model, the Market Agent
incorporates a Market Modular Interface to support other market models.

A bilateral market is a classification for a type of market that allows trades
between two exclusive parties. Examples of bilateral markets include a double
auction and order book trading.

## Applications

We expect that this project will make it easier for communities, facility
owners, and device makers to apply TE. NIST looks to use these agents in
simulations to model TE for regulators and legislators. A complete
implementation of the Common Transactive Services will be highly visible and
widely used.

# Technical Description

The NIST-CTS Project is a standards-based implementation of the Common
Transactive Services and a Market Agent and a Transactive Energy Agent. The
architecture drawing shows terminology and relationships.

Figure Project Architecture Diagram

The project has a number of components and information in a number of subfolders
under [../dev](https://github.com/EnergyMashupLab/NIST-CTS-Agents/blob/dev). We
use *ei2j* (Energy Interoperation to Java) as shorthand for the integration
function.

**Markets**:

-   The Local Market Engine (LME) is the matching engine that coordinates buy
    and sell tenders

-   Markets are connected using the CTS

-   A bilateral market

**Local Market Agent** (LMA): interacts with the local market and with
Transactive Energy User Agents and External Market Adapters using the CTS
including

-   Market Position Management (see note)

-   The Ledger is the record of completed transactions.

-   Price Adjustment hooks, enabling market economics experiments

-   Uses ei2j capabilities for CTS connections

-   Links to external markets via the External Market Adapter (EMA) which is an
    extension of the TEUA

**External Market Adapter** (EMA): an extension of the TEUA, interacts with the
Local Market Agent and a single external market. Functions include

-   Market Position Management

-   The Ledger records completed transactions.

-   Price Adjustment hooks, enabling market economics experiments and
    presentation of markup on wholesale prices

-   Uses ei2j capabilities for CTS connections

**Transactive Energy User Agent** (TEUA): which interacts with the MA and
provides integration capabilities for device and facility management

-   Uses ei2j capabilities for CTS connections

-   Integrates with the Supervisory Controller (SC)

-   Maintains the Ledger, the record of cleared (not pending) transactions (see
    note)

-   Provides information on committed market positions to the SC (see note)

**Utilities:**

-   Common Transactive Services (CTS) implementation

-   ei2j-Energy Interoperation to and from Java, includes CTS implementation

-   Logging (traces) and input for live and simulation meter and other data

-   Ledgers keep records of tenders and transactions.

Note: A ledger is a list in time order of committed transactions. A position is
cumulative committed transactions. A trace of messages includes transactions
proposed but never cleared. Ledgers are saved to a file or possibly sent over a
network connection as the design matures.

The Market Position Manager is a function that tracks completed (cleared)
transactions contained in a ledger to determine committed market positions.
Market position information is needed by the TEUA (on behalf of the SC), and is
maintained by the LMA as transactions are created and cleared.

The TEUA makes information on existing market positions available to the SC,
which in turn can use the information to determine the difference between
committed position and projected needs. The SC can then transact only for what
is needed to align current committed position with projected needs, tendering to
buy or sell as appropriate.

All transactions and clearing flow through the LMA, which through the MPM
function will update the Market Position for use by the TEUA.

### Actors vs. Agents

The difference between Actors and Agents can be a fine one. An actor is an
intelligent resource that has the capacity to initiate, manage, and/or control
activities of given types. An actor can respond to a message it receives by:
making local decisions, creating more actors, sending more messages, or it can
determine how to respond to the next message received.

An agent may be a particular instantiation of an actor. Some distinguish the two
by whether systems can share direct access to external data. In this case, an
agent would be able to access the external data but the actor would not. This
project does not wish to delve into these semantics and generally uses the terms
interchangeably.

## RESTful Web Services 

**Representational State Transfer, better known as REST,** determines a pattern
for distributed systems to exchange messages and information. REST uses the
common pattern of the web (http) to exchange “documents”: GET, POST, UPDATE and
DELETE. In particular, this project uses GET to request information and POST to
send information. UPDATE and DELETE are not used in this system. We specify
system details, such as which TEUA, by using a pattern for the address (or URL)
of the “document”.

Each URL is called a **request** while the data sent back to you is called
a **response**.

A request is made up of four things:

-   The target endpoint

-   The headers

-   The data/body

### Postman

Postman is a collaboration platform for API development. This software helps the
team to design, build and test this project’s APIs.

You can get all the tenders by going to the following URL in Postman:
<http://localhost:8080/tenders/allTenders>

You can screen a specific tender by going to the following URL and select GET.

[http://localhost:8080/tenders/search/{id}](http://localhost:8080/tenders/search/%7bid%7d)

You can create a new tender by going to the following URL and select POST.

<http://localhost:8080/tenders/add>

Similarly, you can delete the tender by going to the assigned URL

### **Controller Class**

The Spring Controller Class is simply a class using REST controller annotation

Spring
Boot [annotations ](http://www.java67.com/2019/01/top-5-spring-boot-annotations-java-programmers-should-know.html)for
handling different HTTP request types:

-   \@RequestMapping — For handling any request type

-   \@GetMapping — GET request

-   \@PostMapping — POST request

-   \@PutMapping — PUT request

-   \@DeleteMapping — DELETE request

Example:

Path variables are variables in the request URL and are annotated with
*\@*PathVariable. The actual value of the request mapping and the HTTP method
determine the target method for the request**.** \@RequestBody will bind the
parameters of the method to the body of the HTTP request,
whereas \@ResponseBody does the same for the response and return type.

### Model Class

Model Class in our case is for Tender which will have tenderID, emixBase,
transactionID, status and date as its properties.

'\@Table(name="EiTender")' is used for creating a table with name EiTender in
the MySQL database.

'\@Column(name="tenderID")' is used to create a column with a particular name
'tenderID' in the EiTender table in the database.

[\@JoinColumn](https://www.baeldung.com/jpa-join-column) annotation helps us
specify the column we will use for joining an entity association or element
collection.

Finally, \@NotNull annotation is used to apply Not Null Constraint on a column.

Getter and Setter methods are used to set and get the required information from
Entity Model.

Example:

# URI Structure for REST Service Operations


POST operations have a RequestBody (the message that is POSTed to the listed
URI) and a ResponseBody (the message body that is returned to the actor doing
the POST). This provides the standard Energy Interoperation messages - a POST
RequestBody contains an EiCreateTender, while the POST ResponseBody contains the
correlated EiCreatedTender.

For this project the principal authors of the base standards flattened the type
hierarchy for only the product (energy) and information elements we use. This
approach maintains standards conformance and allows for

-   A simpler to use and understand type system

-   Simpler Java class definitions for standard payloads

-   A conformance statement at the end of the project

NIST-CTS-Agents uses JSON rather than XML for message payloads. The project uses
Jefferson serialization and deserialization between Java and JSON.

LMA

/createTender POST \@ResponseBody is an EiCreatedTender object

/createTransaction POST \@ResponseBody is an EiCreatedTransaction object

/cancelTender POST \@ResponseBody is an EiCanceledTender object

/party GET \@ResponseBody is an ActorId containing actor’s partyId

LME

/createTender POST \@ResponseBody is an EiCreatedTender object

/cancelTender POST \@ResponseBody is an EiCanceledTender object

/party GET \@ResponseBody is an ActorId containing actor’s partyId

TEUA and EMA

/teua — {id - sequential integer assigned on creation}

/{id}/CreateTransaction POST \@ResponseBody is an EiCreatedTransaction object

/{id}/CreateTender POST \@ResponseBody is an EiCreatedTender object. For user
entity integration

/{id}/party GET \@ResponseBody is an ActorId containing actor’s partyId

Refer to the [Architecture
Diagram](https://github.com/EnergyMashupLab/NIST-CTS-Agents/blob/master/Architecture.png) for
more detail on the RESTcontrollers.

## LMA Pseudocode

Logical Description:

1.  Receive CreateTender service request (from a TEUA) log in transport message
    list

2.  Respond to the TEUA with a CreatedTender log

3.  Adapt and send a [rewritten] CreateTender to LME log in transport message
    list

4.  When LME matches and clears it will send LMA back a CreateTransaction log
    and ledger,

5.  also log in transport message list

6.  Send CreatedTransaction back to LME log and ledger

7.  Send [rewritten] CreateTransaction to requestion UA log and ledger for UA

8.  Receive CreatedTransaction from TEUA log and ledger; update in ledger to
    note acknowledgment

POST methods:

1.  POST action (request from SC, CreateTender for full requirements for a time
    period)

    1.  Query position

    2.  Compare, subtract and POST remaining requirements as CreateTender to
        LMA. Log

    3.  RETURN/POST CreatedTender message to SC

2.  POST action (request from LMA, CreatedTender)

    1.  Log

    2.  Inform SC (callback or POST)

3.  POST action (request from LMA, CreateTransaction for cleared transaction)

    1.  Enter in my Ledger

    2.  Add to my position. Should already be in my position stored at LMA

    3.  RETURN/POST CreatedTransaction to LMA

**NOTES:** Hook in LMA POST method for possible rewrite. Only the hook so can
still experiment with rewrite rules.

## LME Pseudocode

Uses only generated libraries from Parity, specifically parity.libraries.book
and .market, and consumes classes from util.

Logical Description:

1.  Receive a CreateTender service request from LMA log in transport message
    list

2.  Respond to the LMA with a CreatedTender log

3.  Enter the Tender in the Order Book

4.  When tenders match and clear send LMA a CreateTransaction log and ledger
    also log in

5.  transport message list

6.  Receive CreatedTransaction from LMA log and ledger

7.  LMA will send CreateTransaction to requesting UA

POST Methods:

1.  POST action CreateTender (request from LMA, tender for UA net requirements
    for a time period)

    1.  book.market.add(orderID, details) which adds to bid/ask data structures
        as relevant

    2.  RETURN/POST CreatedTender messaged to LMA.

2.  Spontaneous calls from internal MarketListener on match

    1.  Accept callback

    2.  market.execute(orderID, quantity, price) which clears from bid/ask data
        structures as relevant

    3.  POST CreateTransaction to LMA

3.  POST action for CancelTender (request from LMA)

    1.  market.delete(orderID)

    2.  RETURN/POST CanceledTender to LMA

4.  POST CreatedTransaction

    1.  Log

**NOTES:**

1.  The CTS IDs (inherited from idType in EI) should be used in the OrderBook
    (the Parity ID is a long)

2.  CTS does not rewrite tenders in place, so CancelTender == market.delete
    (Parity Cancel adjusts quantity)

## TEUA Pseudocode

Logical Description:

1.  Receive a service request to buy/sell energy (from the SC) and net against
    position for that time period

2.  log in transport message list for debugging

3.  Build net CreateTender payload log with all fields of the Tender (party,
    counterparty, Tender, etc)

4.  Send net CreateTender to LMA (log in transport message list)

5.  Wait to receive a CreatedTender (log receipt) and later a CreateTransaction
    (log and ledger updates)

6.  Update my position (in LMA)

7.  Respond to the CreateTransaction with a CreatedTransaction (log)

POST methods:

1.  POST action CreateTender (request from SC, for full requirements for a time
    period)

    1.  Query position

    2.  Compare, subtract, and POST remaining requirements as CreateTender to
        LMA (log)

    3.  Return CreatedTender message or indication to SC (CTS or callback/return
        on simple method invocation or POST)

2.  POST action CreatedTender (from LMA)

    1.  Log

    2.  Respond to SC (callback or POST)

3.  POST action CreateTransaction (request from LMA, CreateTransaction for
    cleared transaction)

    1.  Enter in my logical Ledger (correct to place in LMA ledger for query,
        logically specific to this TEUA)

    2.  Add to my postion should already be in my position as stored at LMA

    3.  POST CreatedTransaction to LMA

**NOTES:**

1.  The SC might invoke a method OR use a RESTful web service; the latter is
    possible if in the same code space/JVM as the TEUA.

2.  Position manger is attached to LMA, not to each UA.

3.  The position manager can be a separate RESTful service. It needs to be
    queried by other than the LMA.

# Position Manager

The payload for the position manager is stored in the
org.theenergymashuplab.cts.controller.payloads package. The REST call methods
that access the position manager are stored in this package.

Position Manager Controller Methods:

-   createPosition: Will add position into the table.

-   getPositionHistoryToId: Fetch position from table with respect to the
    sellerId.

-   getPositionHistoryFromId: Fetch position from table with respect to the
    buyerId.

-   getPositionHistory: Fetch position from table with respect to the count.

-   getStatus: Fetch status from table given the id of respective position id.

The model for the position manager is stored in org.theenergymashuplab.cts.model
package. This model represents the database table structure .

The position repository is stored in org.theenergymashuplab.cts.repository
package. This is where the native queries are stored.

# Logging

Please note that Log4j 2 functions are included through the Spring Boot Starter
for Log4j 2, spring-boot-starter-log4j2. This project will continue using that
version until we need to update either Log4j 2 or Spring Boot.

The Apache Log4j 2 2.11.2 library is used for logging. This version was
published February 2019, and is available in the Maven Central Repository in
log4j-core 2.11.2 and log4j-api 2.11.2. The base library is available at the
Apache Log4j 2 archives

In the NIST-CTS-Agents repository, the configuration file is in
/dev/src/main/resources/log4j2.xml.

Logs are stored on your local system in the dev/logs folder. Ledgers are stored
on your local system in the dev/ledger folder. Ledgers (see the project README)
contain committed transactions, and may be used to build an actor's position.

## Logging Levels

Log4j 2 supports conventional and standard logging levels as well as custom
levels. The standard levels are, from most specific to least specific (and
lowest IntLevel to highest) is:

-   OFF (most specific, no logging)

-   FATAL (most specific, little data)

-   ERROR

-   WARN

-   INFO

-   DEBUG

-   TRACE (least specific, a lot of data)

-   ALL (least specific, all data)

More information on the logging levels is available from the Apache Log4j 2
documentation.

## Log4j2.xml

There are two types of rolling logs, one is for normal logging and the other is
for ledgers. All logs described here are tab-separated text to simplify analysis
with Excel and other spreadsheets (rather than for best human readability).

All the of logs from org.theenergymashuplab go in the logs folder dev/logs of
your local system and print on the console.

The levels set are TRACE (used rarely) and INFO; see the source code and
dev/src/main/resources/log4j2.xml. The level that is outputted can be changed in
log4j2.xml.

Logs created by
org.theenergymashuplab.cts.controller.payloads.EiCreateTransactionType are set
to level INFO and will go to the ledger folder.

The trace level to be logged can be changed in log4j2.xml.

All the logs generated by hibernate (for MySQL interactions) will be printed on
console and go to the application general log.

# Built With

If you are using Spring Tools Suit 4 for Eclipse you do not need to download
Apache Tomcat 9. Only download Apache Tomcat 9 if you are using the regular
Eclipse IDE for development.

For Windows, MacOSX and Linux systems you will need:

-   Java 8 JDK

-   Maven 3.x

-   Spring Tool Suite 4 for Eclipse

-   MySQL 5.1 or later

-   MySQL Workbench 5.1 or later

MySQL Workbench may require a MacOS system update.

# Running

Importing Maven Projects from Git into Eclipse

Step 1: Select the folder where you want to create the local storage (on your
local machine). Right click and select ‘Git Bash Here’.

Step 2: Use the command ‘git clone’ to create a clone of the repository

Step 3: In Eclipse select the File menu and then select Import

Step 4: Select Existing Maven Projects and click on next. (Note that Eclipse
from the Spring Boot download and direct download work the same)

Step 5: Browse to the local NIST-CTS-Agents folder (cloned from Github) and
click finish. The project is now imported in Eclipse.

Step 6: Right click on project, go to Run As and select Maven Build.

You will get a Build success message in the console. Note that the Build button
will use the most recent detailed build instructions during the current
execution of the Eclipse environment

Step 7: Configure Tomcat Server

Detailed notes at [this
site](https://professionalhacker.in/how-to-install-tomcat-on-mac/)

Step 8: Select tomcat server from the list of those installed on your local
machine and click next.

Spring Tool Suite 4.5 does not have this wizard selector; instead for Step 8 and
Step 9 right click on the project and select a server.

Step 9: Move the project to configure it to the server *Picture shows after
selecting the project and clicking Add*

Step 10: Create the Database

Database initialization was done using MySql Community Edition and Workbench
8.0.18 on Mac OS X 10.15.2. SpringTool Suit 4 and JDBC will initialize the
database and schemas with no manual intervention when using the developement
enviroment mentioned before.

If you are not using this enviroment, you may have to create the database and
schemas manually. Username is set as eml\@localhost and the password is set as
capstone123.

Manual Database Initialization:

1.  In MySql Workbench, create a new user "eml" with the password "capstone123".

2.  Create a new "Schema" (database show with the disk icon) called nist_cts_eml

3.  Give user capstone permission to access nist_cts_eml from localhost

4.  Remember to apply all changes and refresh the nist_cts_eml schema.

5.  Run the project application in SpringToolSuite

6.  In MySql Workbench, refresh all for the schema nist_cts_eml.

Step 11: Right click on the project, go to Run As, and click on Spring Boot App.
You can also use Run As → Run on Server.

Step 12: The project is now running. Open the browser and go to localhost:8080
to view the project

# Testing

JUnit is an open source unit testing framework for Java. It is useful for Java
developers to write and run repeatable tests for small chunks of code.

When using JUnit in Spring, there are several features added that many
developers are not aware of.

First, if you are including the Spring Context in your tests, it becomes an
Integration Test, no longer a Unit Test.

To integrate Spring with JUnit, you need spring-test.jar Specifying dependencies
in pom.xml.

Example:

## Creating Unit Test Classes


For the unit tests to run a batch job, the framework must load the job’s
ApplicationContext. The annotations \@RunWith(SpringRunner.class) and
\@ContextConfiguration are used to trigger this behavior.

\@RunWith(SpringRunner.class) indicates that the class should use Spring’s JUnit
facilities

\@ContextConfiguration indicates which resources to configure the
ApplicationContext with. In this application, we use \@Autoconfigure with
\@WebMvcTest, imported from
org.springframework.boot.test.autoconfigure.web.servlet.WebMvcTest, which will
disable full auto-configuration and instead apply only configuration relevant to
MVC tests, i.e. \@Controller \@ControllerAdvice, \@JsonComponent,
\@Converter/\@GenericConverter, \@Filter, \@WebMvcConfigurer and
\@HandlerMethodArgumentResolver beans but not \@Component, \@Service or
\@Repository beans.

By default, tests annotated with \@WebMvcTest will also auto-configure Spring
Security and MockMvc, including support for HtmlUnit WebClient and Selenium
WebDriver. For more fine-grained control of MockMVC the \@AutoConfigureMockMvc
annotation can be used. Typically \@WebMvcTest is used in combination with
\@MockBean or \@Import to create any collaborators required by your \@Controller
beans.

Example:

The above code structure is a Text fixture. A test fixture is a context where a
Test Case runs. Typically, test fixtures include:

-   Objects or resources that are available for any test case.

-   Activities that make these objects/resources available such as:

    -   Allocation (setup)

    -   De-allocation (teardown)

If you are looking to load your full application configuration, you should
consider \@SpringBootTest.
