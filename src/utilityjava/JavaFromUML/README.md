NIST-CTS Java Code Templates and Subset UML Diagrams
=================================================
The Java code in this folder was generated from the OASIS Energy Interoperation 1.0 UML model (informative, not normative), updated to match the XML Schemas and JSON subsets of September 27 2019.

These files support creation of Java code for the ei2j and CTS components.

The files are
* UML Diagrams Updated 20190926.zip - Gives UML diagrams and indicates which are not or are unlikely to be used in the project
* EIClasses Subset 20190926.zip - Java type definitions for the subsetted types model, one file per definition.
* EiPayloads Subset 20190926.zip - Java type definitions for the subsetted payloads model, one file per payload definition
* ICalendar-streams-extensions 20190926.zip - Java type definitions for the streams extensions, used for all time intervals

Generation was by Enterprise Architect 15.0.
