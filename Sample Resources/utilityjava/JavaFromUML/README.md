=================================================
The Java code in this folder was generated from the OASIS Energy Interoperation 1.0 UML model (informative, not normative), updated to match the XML Schemas and JSON subsets as of October 5, 2019 (CTS 0.3).

These files support creation of Java code for the ei2j and CTS components.

The files are
* UML Diagrams Updated 20191005.zip - Gives UML diagrams for the subset of classes being used in the project
* Java Types - After Artifact Accommodation 20191005.zip - Java type definitions for the subsetted types model, one file per definition, divided into folders for 
** EiClasses Subset 20191005
** EiPayloads Subset 20191005
** Emix  Subset 20191005
