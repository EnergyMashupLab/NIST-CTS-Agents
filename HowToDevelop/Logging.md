Logging
====================

Apache Log4j2 2.11.2 library is used for logging.
One can download it from https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.0/download.html

NIST-CTS-Agents\dev\src\main\resources\log4j2.xml has all the configurations needed for logging.

Logs are stored on your local system in NIST-CTS-Agents\dev\logs folder.
Ledger are stored on your local system in NIST-CTS-Agents\dev\ledger folder.

## Log4j2.xml:

There are two types of rolling logs one is for normal log and other is for ledger.

All the logs of org.theenergymashuplab will go in logs folder and print on console, which has trace level. The trace level can be changed in log4j2.xml.

All the logs created by org.theenergymashuplab.cts.controller.payloads.EiCreateTransactionType  will go to ledger folder, and the level is trace. The trace level can be changed in log4j2.xml. The textual information is in the ledger file in a fixed format which one might format differently for readability.

All the logs generated by hibernate (for MySQL interactions) will be printed on console. 

All the logs generated are tab seperated.
