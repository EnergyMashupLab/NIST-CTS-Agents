Technical Description Transactive Energy (User) Agent (TEA)
---------------------

The NIST-CTS Project is a standards-based implementation of the Common
Transactive Services and a Market Agent and a Transactive Energy Agent. See the
respective repositories' README files for a closer view; see  the project See the project [README](README.md) for an overview

WILL CHANGE WHEN MOVED TO SEPARATE REPOSITORY ../MarketAgent

-   **Transactive Energy Agent** (TEA) which interacts with the MA and provides
    integration capabilities for device and facility management

The terminmology **User Agent** is consistent with X.500 series and mail systems where the user is represented by
a "user agent". In effect the TEA will act as a "skin" to present energy buy and sell requests from the System Controller
to present to and receive from the Market Agent (MA) which encapsulates markets.

Built With
----------

Agile programming and architecture are used.

The project will use Github, Maven, and Java 8.
